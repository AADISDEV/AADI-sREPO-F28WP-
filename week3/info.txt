The slideshow was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being the main tools used for design and functionality. 
The slideshow was smoothly integrated into the website's design thanks to the use of CSS styles and an 
HTML framework that included a special container for photos. Image transitions were made easier by JavaScript logic, 
which used a timer and an array of image paths to switch between images at predefined intervals. 

During the development process, other obstacles surfaced, such as optimizing the speed at which images loaded, when 
obtaining images from external sources. Preloading pictures, saving images locally, and utilizing responsive design strategies all 
helped to overcome these difficulties.
